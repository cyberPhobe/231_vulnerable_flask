# 231 Vulnerable Flask Web Application
Vulnerable Flask Application written for Cpr E 231 at Iowa State University. Caution: here be dragons!

## Notes

* This was built over a long period of time to simulate what *could and does* happen to some unfortunate modern-day websites. This is supposed to be a mainly realistic site (with tons of modern-day security issues)!
* For best results, use this application on a Linux machine. Ubuntu is nice and user-friendly for beginners!

## Prerequisites
The following will need to be installed prior to running:
* Python 3 and pip
* Flask library

## Deployment
By default, this application will listen on port 5000. To run the server, run this command in the root directory of the web application:
```
python3 flaskApp.py
```

## Warning!
DO NOT EXPOSE THIS APP PUBLICALLY ON THE INTERNET!! THIS COULD RESULT IN YOUR MACHINE OR NETWORK BECOMING COMPROMISED!!!

*You are responsible for your machine(s) running this application. There are not any warranties or guarantees, written or implied, in the distribution of this software. I am not responsible for any destruction or loss of property by, or for using this vulnerable software.*
